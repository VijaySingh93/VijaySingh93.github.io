    <h3 class="title">Projects</h3>
    <p>Have worked on multiple projects in web development and Deep Learning. Some of these are given below.</p>

    <ul class="grid">
      <li>
        <i class="fa fa-bicycle fa-4x"></i>
        <h4>Bicycle Estimation</h4>
        <p>Built and trained a neural network to predict the number of bicycles required at a bike rental service on a given day.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i class="fa fa-camera-retro fa-4x"></i>
        <h4>Image Classification</h4>
        <p>In this project, the task is to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset had been preprocessed, then trained a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The
          images were normalized, one-hot encoded the labels, build a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer. At then end, predictions were made for an unknown image.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i class="fas fa-tv fa-4x"></i>
        <h4>TV Script Generation</h4>
        <p>Generated Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. Used part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. The Neural Network generates a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <i class="fas fa-grin-alt fa-4x"></i>
        <h4>Generating Faces</h4>
        <p>Used generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.</p>
      </li>

    <p class="quote">“I visualize a time when we will be to robots what dogs are to humans, and I’m rooting for the machines.”</p>
    <p class="author">—Claude Shannon</p>
    <p class="quote">“Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of Google. The ultimate search engine that would understand everything on the web. It would understand exactly what you wanted, and it would give you the right thing. We're nowhere near doing
      that now. However, we can get incrementally closer to that, and that is basically what we work on.”</p>
    <p class="author">—Larry Page</p>
    <p class="quote">“Learning HTML and CSS is a lot more challenging than it used to be. Responsive web design adds more layers of complexity to design and develop websites.”</p>

    <p>Have an idea to work on, or just need someone to code along? Provide your email and I will definitely respond. Perhaps we could grab a cold one together <span class="fa fa-glass-martini-alt"></span></p>
